# Testing Standards

## Test Organization
- Place tests in `__tests__` directory
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use clear, descriptive test names

## Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern:
  1. Arrange - Set up test data
  2. Act - Execute the code being tested
  3. Assert - Verify the results

## Test Coverage
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Include integration tests for critical paths

## Best Practices
- Keep tests independent
- Avoid test interdependence
- Clean up after each test
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup/teardown
- Mock external dependencies

## Assertions
- Use explicit assertions
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use appropriate matchers
- Include meaningful error messages

## Mocking
- Mock external dependencies
- Use jest.mock() for module mocking
- Reset mocks between tests
- Verify mock calls when relevant

## Test Data
- Use factories for test data
- Keep test data minimal
- Use meaningful test data names
- Avoid sharing mutable test data

## Performance
- Keep tests fast
- Avoid unnecessary async operations
- Use setup/teardown hooks efficiently
- Group similar tests together
